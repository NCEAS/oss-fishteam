A weather forecast was provided to the Miami Marine Safety Office that indicated onshore winds through the weekend with a significant velocity increase on Sunday, 10 March.  An initial trajectory analysis indicated that any release of oil would likely move toward shore to the west fairly quickly ; within 2-3 hours.  If all 6500 gallons of oil were released, it would likely create a sheen visible for 2-3 miles which would spread  towards the west.  Shoreline staining from the diesel would not be likely beyond 2 miles from the point of release.  Oiled debris, seagrass and sargasm may need to be cleaned from the beach.  With diesel, localized and short term toxic effects would be of concern.  USCG district 7.",NA,NA,NA

The NOAA SSC contacted the HAZMAT Duty Officer who arranged for ""Home Team"" scientific support.  Given the high probability of loss of diesel fuel and lube oils on board the vessel and the possibility of an uncontrolled well blow-out, the SSC requested that the event be addressed as a potential major release.	Weather forecast and trajectory implications were developed by the NOAA HAZMAT Home Team and verbally communicated to the USCG.  Given the forecast on an approaching winter frontal passage and the distance off-shore (25 plus miles), no landfall of oil was forecast for the next several days.  Any diesel fuel released would not persist more than a couple of miles from the release point due to the chemical nature of diesel oil and relative high seas (4-5').  The SSC also consulted with the Texas State SSC relative to trajectory implications.  	At approximately 2100 hrs, the USCG called to update the situation:  The lift boat did explode.  The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.  Six people were injured (broken bones and burns), but at this point, no fatalities.  The sub-sea safety valve was shut preventing any release from the well, and the well was reported to only be producing water at the time of the explosion.  This is still preliminary information, but the USCG was confident that there was no apparent well release based on confirming observations from a USCG vessel on-scene.  The lift boat was damaged, but the fuel tanks were reported to be intact.  Given the updated situation and the low probability of shoreline impacts from any minor release, the NOAA team is standing-down, but remains on stand by.  USCG district 8.",NA,NA,NA

One report estimated 35,000 lbs of phosphoric acid diluted into a ""million"" gallons of water was released into a small ditch which eventually emptied into the Houston Ship Channel.  A verbal assessment of the behavior of the chemical and possible risks was provided after contacting Dr. Ed Overton at LSU for his chemistry prospective and a review of the CAMEO data.  	Water monitoring had already began using a pH meter.  The verbal results passed to the SSC indicated that the ditch was at pH 2 (bottom of the acid scale).  However, within 40 feet of entering the ship channel, the values were neutral or background.

The four barges had broken loose from the towboat and three were fully involved in fire.  An unknown amount of gasoline was leaking into the river.

NOAA was asked to provided scientific support relative to possible fate scenarios and resources at risk.  The river was at normal-to-low water levels, and well within its banks.  Therefore, the resources of greatest risk are those in the river itself.  Gasoline is expected to completely evaporate, so the risk to aquatic resources is from acute toxicity from exposure to the highly soluble toxic fractions and near the source.  Transport down river was not expected to be uniform.  Gasoline could collect in eddies and oxbows, and present a potential for downstream localized hazards.  In these collection areas, the gasoline could also absorb to available organic material.  In addition, a local toxic shock to biota in shallow nearby areas was possible.  Pallid sturgeon (a listed endangered species) were present in the river, but were predicted to be concentrate at the control structure (upstream of the release site and not at significant risk).  Other rare species thought present in the river at the time of the incident were paddlefish and blue suckers.  These fish are highly mobile able to avoid exposures that would result in death.  Exceptions might be to juvenile fish in shallow areas close to the shoreline.  The greatest risk was to the commercial fishery.  An estimated 25-30 commercial fishermen worked the stretch threatened.  Commercial fisheries at risk included buffalo, freshwater drum, and several species of catfish.  Other resources present in the area included eagles and wading bird colonies.  For two days the barges were allowed to burn.  When the fire significant subsided, fire suppression experts attached the fire with water and foam.  The barges were then allowed to cool and possible reignition minimized by a foam blanket.

The location of the spill was 60 miles offshore.  The spill resulted when an anchor from a semi-submersible drilling rig dragged across and damaged a 24"" pipeline at both the impact site and at a platform more than a mile away.  Oil was released from both locations.  The water depth was greater than 400 feet.  The initial release volume, based on the amount of oil transferred between the time of the incident and shut in was 1839 bbl.  The line was owned by Equilon Pipeline and identified as part of the Poseidon Pipeline System.  The NOAA SSC relocated to the Shell Command Post at the request of the USCG to support the on-scene incident commander.  Preliminary trajectories suggested that the oil would move west and north.  Landfall was not predicted for several days.  The type of oil was a medium sour crude with an API gravity of 31.5.  Such oils may form persistent tarballs and be transported long distances.  Skimmers were activated.  Given the potential for environmental injury from the spill, dispersants were evaluated and approved under the RRT6 preapproval guidelines by the COTP Morgan City.  The sea state (10-15 knot winds and 4-5 foot seas) was ideal for oil dispersion.  Between 1530 CST and dusk, a total of 3000 gallons were applied (1000 gallons by DC-3 and 2000 gallons by DC-4).

The cause of the release is still under investigation.  Between 850 and 1200 bbls of a deep well production oil was released.  The oil was identified as MARS Blend, a relatively high sulfur, low asphaltene crude oil.  The initial trajectory predicted the oil would move south of Four Bayous pass and sustained north winds would move most of the oil offshore.  The winds were less than the forecast and the spill coincided with a spring tide (not the season Spring, but the description of the time in the tide cycle characterized by the greatest high and low tides, derived from spring up or rise).  Much of the oil moved back into Four Bayous and Barataria Pass.  The next morning.  Heavy concentrations of oil were observed on shorelines and on water.  The NOAA SSC participated in a morning overflight (pre-SCAT survey) on Thanksgiving morning to delineate oiled shorelines and surface oil.  Heavy surface oil concentrations north of Grand Terre and south of Four Bayous Pass were identified and skimmers repositioned.  Heavy oil was observed on the barrier islands of Barataria Bay.  The barrier islands impacted were Elmer's Island, Grand Isle, Grand Terre, and East Grand Terre.  The latter two were the heaviest impacted and the most remote (no road access).  Stranded oil was heaviest near the passes and on the eastern end of each island.  At least one marina at Grand Isle was impacted.	By Friday (two days after the spill), overflights looked encouraging.  Very little oil was visually observed on the beaches and on-water sheens were significantly reduced; unfortunately, most of the oil was buried by depositional sand and the lower tide level was preventing remobilization of stranded oil.  	The SCAT team used the aerial pre-SCAT survey to aid shoreline assessments since the heavily oiled beach areas were previously identified, but now mostly hidden by over-laying sand.  SCAT was an essential element in the response and used by the Unified Command to define areas which required cleanup as well as monitoring cleanup activities to insure that the cleanup recommendations were both adequate and adhered to by field crews.  More than 100 cleanup works were engaged in this response.  Cleanup objectives and endpoints were developed within the SCAT organization.  SCAT recommendations developed a balance between preserving beach sand (a valued state resource) and minimizing potential environmental threats.  		At the end of the day (Sunday, 28 Nov.), only five sites are still being cleaned.  Of particular interest are a small marsh on the interior of East Grand Terre and a Gobi revetment (riprap) along the Conoco facility on the north side of Grand Isle (see Hotline #15 pictures, EGT and GIC, respectively).  Both sites contain free oil.  Both sites present unique cleanup problems.

The amount released was unknown.  Subsequent USCG overflights observed no visible sheens associated with the fishing vessel.  Since no sheens were observed, there was reason to suspect that a majority of the diesel fuel was still on-board.  The USCG considered the sunken vessel a hazard to both navigation and the environment.  While diesel is generally considered a nonpersistant oil with a relatively high evaporation rate and natural dispersion rate, most diesel fuel oils are, at the same time, highly toxic.  The NOAA SSC was asked to provide information to assess potential spill trajectories and possible environmental affects related to the sunken fishing boat.

In particular, the area around San Luis Pass is an important feeding and loafing area for shorebirds, gulls, terns, loons, pelicans, and wading birds.  At the time of the spill, because of the very early spring weather, many birds were staging along the beaches, particularly shorebirds who are feeding to bulk up for the migration to nesting areas.  Though shorebirds have a lower tendency to get oiled (compared to diving birds who spend much of their time on the water surface or diving for prey) they spend a lot of time feeding at the water/land interface where any tarballs that come ashore are likely to concentrate.  With onshore winds, the ultimate fate of any persistent oil was shoreline stranding.  Normally, tarballs on shore are not an issue because they are easy to clean up.

It was determined that the slick would most likely move to the WNW of the reported position at approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of a knot.  The reported position was as of 1730 on Saturday afternoon and due to logistical constraints the MSU was unable to schedule an overflight until Sunday afternoon.  In this interim the slick could be expected to move 10 miles to the WNW.On Sunday afternoon the Coast Guard conducted an overflight and with the trajectory information provided, they were able to successfully locate the slick.  The overflight revealed a 200 x 200 yard slick of light brown oil which was somewhat patchy.

It is possible that the release was gradual over the course of weeks or months until the material released reached a level that caused a visible reaction in the waters of the barge canal.  The spill site is actually two water bodies; an industrial barge canal in Bienville Industrial Park and a freshwater riverine/marsh habitat in the adjacent Mulatto Bayou.  Mulatto Bayou runs somewhat parallel to the barge canal with several bank cuts allowing water interchange between the two.Hopper barges RL-224 and RL-229 had been alongside the industrial park at the dead end of the barge canal for several weeks and several months, respectively.  Their cargo of dry ferrous sulfate was destined for Eaglebrook Inc. but was rejected because it was out of specification for their needs.  Ferrous sulfate is reacted in a controlled situation by Eaglebrook to make a flocculating agent used in wastewater treatment.  As the barges waited at the industrial park pending final disposition, it is believed that water entered the barges through holes in their wing tanks and then, through free communication with the hoppers themselves, made contact with the cargo.  During the response the contaminated water in the hoppers was found to have a pH of approximately 2.0.  The contaminated water in the wing tanks was found to have a pH of approximately 3.0.

MSO Tampa closed the port to vessel traffic.  This collision caused three separate emergencies:  1) the Balsa 37,  which was carrying a cargo of phosphate rock, was severely damaged on the starboard side, was listing at an increasing rate, and was in danger of capsizing in the channel; 2) the Ocean 255, which was loaded with jet fuel, gasoline, and a small amount of diesel fuel was burning out of control just south of Mullet Key; and 3) the Bouchard 155  was holed at the port bow spilling approximately 8,000 barrels of #6 fuel oil into Tampa Bay.Stabilizing the vessels was the first priority of responders.  By 2200 the Ocean 255 barge fire was extinguished and the GST was conducting cooling procedures and maintaining a fire watch.  Lightering operations were well underway on the Bouchard 155 barge in preparation for moving it to dockage in the Port of Tampa where it would be cleaned before dry docking.  The Balsa 37 was intentionally grounded outside the shipping channel to prevent it from capsizing and to open the channel for traffic while repairs and stability evaluations were conducted.August 10 overflight observations showed a three- to six-meter wide band of oil along the beaches.  By the next day, this band appeared to be about half its original width.  Systematic shoreline surveys were conducted and oil was found buried by two to eight inches of clean sand deposited during high tide.  Cleanup crews focused on manually removing the band of surface oil high on the beach.  A plan was developed to remove the subsurface oil without generating large volumes of sediment for handling, disposal, and replacement.  The plan called for mechanical removal of the heavy buried layers, manual removal of moderately oiled sediments, and mechanically pushing stained sand onto the lower part of the beach for surf washing.  Pompoms were strung along the surf zone to collect any oil refloated during the surf washing.By August 11 the status of the vessels had improved substantially.  The response focus began to change from  emergency issues to skimming operations, protection strategies, forecasts, and planning.Meanwhile, cleanup crews were contending with very thick oil that had been deposited around some mangrove islands.  Tarmats formed when sediment was mixed with oil along the shallow flats surrounding the islands.  Large thick mats coated mangrove roots, oyster and seagrass beds, and tidal mud flats.  Most of this oil was vacuumed out using vacuum transfer units on grounded barges staged around the islands and shallow areas.  Seawalls within the bay were being washed using high-pressure water heated to 110 degrees.The GST was onscene throughout the spill response.  They provided support with the Vessel of Opportunity Skimming System as well as the fire fighting, monitoring, and lightering of the Ocean 255 barge.Roughly 14.5 miles of fine-grained sand beach from St. Petersburg Beach north to Redington Shores Beach were affected by this spill.  Sand beaches on Egmont Key at the entrance to Tampa Bay were also oiled.  Additionally, four mangrove islands inside the entrance to Boca Ciega Bay at Johns Pass and two small areas of Spartina marsh were oiled.  Jetties, seawalls, and riprap within the bay and at Johns Pass and Blind Pass were also oiled to varying degrees.  It is estimated that over 30 miles of residential seawalls were oiled within Boca Ciega Bay.  Some impact also occurred on the northern side of Mullet Key at Bonne Fortune Key in fringing mangroves.Seawalls, jetties, walkways, and riprap were cleaned by high-pressure hot-water washes.  PES-51 was considered for some of these cleaning needs, but after observing comparison tests performed by the manufacturer, the RP decided against its use.Cleanup of submerged tarmats offshore is ongoing.  NOAA is working with the  RRT, the GST, the Army Corps of Engineers, the FOSC, State officials, and various scientists and engineers to develop a sound method for dealing with the tarmats.

The spill was possibly from bilge pumping.  The identity of the spiller is unknown at this time.  The spilled waste oil is suspected to have been treated with bilge cleaner by the spiller. The spilled oil initially impacted approximately 2 miles of the south bank of the Neches River.  The impact was in pockets along the shoreline and had moderately impacted some marshy areas associated with the small pockets of oil. The salinity of the river water in the vicinity of the spill is estimated at 0.1 ppt (estimate made by MSO Port Arthur).  The  current in the area of the spill is estimated at no more than 0.5 kts.

There is an estimated 15-25 gallons of the waste oil remaining in these two outlets that would be treated with the OSE II. The above change in locations was mentioned at the conference call that took place on October 17 at 1230 CT.  During the call RRT members voiced concerns over the lack of an appropriate monitoring plan, the chemistry of the waste oil, the need to acquire the  approval of the land owner to test on Dupont land, and the lack of a plan to handle the treated product in the event of flooding that would require Dupont to empty the waste oil and product into the Neches River.

On-site, the NOAA Scientific Support Coordinator (SSC) observed two badly corroded barges lying nearly end-to-end, leaking an unknown oily substance into the waters of the channel.  Some boom had been deployed around portions of the barges and numerous vessels of lengths up to 35 feet, in various stages of maintenance or disrepair surrounded the barge hulls.   Because the barges were unattended and threatened by local high water runoff and local vessel traffic, the SSC recommended immediate efforts to double boom and isolate the barges.  Security measures were suggested to prevent tampering and further damage to the barges until the material within could be properly identified, safely removed and isolated for disposal.  ""Core"" samples from each tank and Level B personnel protection were also strongly recommended.  In addition, the SSC recommended that local and state water board, storm levy and canal lock officials be contacted to ensure immediate emergency response should waters from the spill site and Doullut Canal have to be isolated from the Mississippi River and the sensitive areas of Adams Bay and surrounding wetlands.

For example, when it is windy, the bloom, that is often concentrated near the surface, can be mixed down several feet and thus become almost invisible.  If the wind subsides and the sun conditions are right, these organisms can float or swim back to the surface and again become much more visible.  USCG district 7.",NA,NA,NA

The cargo of catalytic cracker feedstock and Santa Maria crude oil spilled into the sea as the fire burned for ten hours.   Lightning apparently ignited accumulated cargo vapors on the deck of the vessel.  None of the cargo tanks had been gas-freed.  The explosion was so powerful that a 5 foot by 7 foot hull fragment from the burning vessel penetrated the roof of a Shell Oil Company petroleum product shore tank located 600 feet inland from the vessel.

Weather at the time was mild with clear skies, wind at 10 knots out of the SW, and seas 1-2 feet.  Apparently, the ship was on autopilot with the radar turned off when the watch was relieved at midnight.  The charts that were in use were not up-to-date and showed no fixed structures on the ship's trackline.  When the radar was turned at 0030, nothing was visible.  At 0045, the radar revealed an object approximately 9 miles away on the starboard side of the vessel.  The Captain of the vessel claimed that he saw no navigational lights on the platform even though a Chevron spokesman said they were functioning properly.  The mate failed to plot the object.  At 0130, the port bow of the vessel struck the eastern side of the platform, opening up a gash 2 feet wide by the length of the bow tank.  The cargo ignited and the fire spread towards 15 drums of lube oil.  An emergency call was made and the ship was abandoned while fire and smoke engulfed the forward port section of the ship.Personnel working on other platforms in the area immediately responded to the accident.  Six utility boats surrounded the Globtik Sun within 30 minutes.  Two Coast Guard cutters and four aircraft arrived on-scene on August 15.  The charred vessel was towed by McAllister Towing to Galveston on August 18.  The Globtik Sun was later sold for scrap.  USCG district 8.  Keyword: Fire, collision, salvage, lightering..",NA,NA,NA

The bow of the T/V Mayo Lykes, penetrated the port bow of the barge at a 45-60 degree angle, and almost cut the barge in two.  Only the starboard outer skin of the barge held the vessel together.A large quantity of the 23,000 barrels of Louisiana crude oil and Bunker C spilled into the water upon impact.  Later estimates reported 10,000 barrels of pollutant spilled into the water.  Part of the spilled amount was released in the collision while the remainder leaked from the damaged tanks over the next several days.  Weather conditions at the time of the accident were extremely adverse.  Extensive fog, winds of 30-35 knots with 40 knot gusts, and seas of 3-4 feet hampered early containment attempts.  Since the owner and operator of the damaged barge denied any responsibility in cleaning up the oil, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) personnel began cleanup operations using the Oil Spill Contingency Fund.  Brine Service Company was the primary cleanup contractor from March 12 until March 18 when Clean Channel Industries became the principal contractor, focusing on beach cleanup.  After March 12, the USCG took on a strictly supervisory and monitoring role while contract personnel performed the actual cleanup.Two days after the spill, the local Audubon Society, with USCG assistance, collected and cleaned approximately 400 oil soaked Eared Grebes.  The 320 surviving birds were released in an unpolluted area selected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.  The Texas Department of Health, EPA Region 6, and Texas A&M University conducted ecological and pollutant studies in the affected area.  Preliminary results showed little long-term adverse effect to the environment.  Active cleanup continued until April 6 when the case officially closed, however cleaning on Atkinson and Bulkhead Reef Islands to the east of the Houston Ship Channel continued until the week of April 9.

Platform 26 exploded and caught fire.  The platform included 22 production wells with a capacity of 15,000 barrels of crude oil per day.  The flames from the burning platform blazed 400 feet into the air.  The 21-B well, with a 424-barrel per day capacity, ruptured 12 feet above the water.  By December 3, the service crane had collapsed towards the center of the platform at a 60? angle.  Burning oil covered the surface of the water within 50 feet of the platform.  By December 7, well No. 21-B was contributing to 30-50 percent of the fire.  Shifting winds, fog and rough seas slowed response efforts at times.Holes were shot into the tubing of some of the wells to determine whether oil was still being produced.  On January 12, Shell Oil Co. personnel perforated a relief well in an attempt to contain the flow.  On January 20, eight of the wells remained on fire.  Corexit 7664 dispersant was applied to the slick at a rate of 3 barrels per hour.Response operations began moderating on March 1.  A U.S. Coast Guard cutter and helicopter were released from the scene.  Shell Oil Co. officials were required to submit daily pollution reports to the U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP), New Orleans, in advance of any operations that may have increased pollution.  Drilling, capping, and pumping of the wells continued throughout April.  By April 16, the estimated rate of release was 20 barrels per day.  The slick was reportedly staying within a 6-mile radius of the platform, with sheen extending to 12 miles.  The slick was reduced to sheen during the following months as pumping and capping operations continued.Beach surveys were conducted by personnel from the U.S. Coast Guard, Shell Oil Co., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries, and other local observers.  The only shoreline oiling that resulted from the incident was  between Caminada Pass and Bay Champagne.  The case was closed by the U.S. Coast Guard on May 17, 1971.  The explosion and subsequent fire killed four people and seriously burned 37 others.  USCG district 8.",NA,NA,NA
