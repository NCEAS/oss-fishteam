"A Comparison of Size Structure, Age, and Growth of Red Snapper from Artificial and Natural Habitats in the Western Gulf of Mexico.","Streich, Matthew K.; Ajemian, Matthew J.; Wetz, Jennifer J.; Williams, Jason A.; Shipley, J.

Although the stock is now showing signs of recovery, management could benefit from a better understanding of regional or even habitat-level differences in stock demographics, as these dynamics ultimately determine overall stock productivity. From 2012 to 2014, we used a fishery-independent vertical line survey to assess Red Snapper relative abundance, size and age structure, and growth parameters at standing oil and gas platforms, decommissioned platform artificial reefs, and natural banks in the western GOM. We captured 1,170 Red Snapper ranging from 275 to 855 mm TL. Vertical line CPUE data showed no differences among the three habitat types. Ages determined for 1,143 individuals ranged from 2 to 30 years; however, most (90%) were younger than age 8. Size and age frequencies revealed that natural banks supported a greater proportion of large and relatively old fish compared to standing platforms or artificial reefs, although this difference was heavily influenced by a single bank that had significantly larger and older Red Snapper than other sites. Mean age was not significantly different among habitat types. Among a suite of growth models fitted to size-at-age data, the logistic model provided the best fit and suggested that fish from artificial reefs reached larger sizes at age than fish from either standing platforms or natural banks. Our study provides the first estimates of habitat-specific growth parameters for Red Snapper in the western GOM, and this information can benefit future stock assessments. This study also highlights the potential benefits of artificial reefs to Red Snapper and indicates that all habitats could contribute similarly to stock productivity on a per-unit-area basis.

"Age Composition, Growth, and Density-Dependent Mortality in Juvenile Red Snapper Estimated from Observer Data from the Gulf of Mexico Penaeid Shrimp Fishery.","GAZEY, WILLIAM J.; GALLAWAY, BENNY J.; COLE, JOHN G.; FOURNIER, DAVID A.",North American Journal of Fisheries Management,2755947,,Dec-08,28,6,1828,15,36871572,10.1577/M07-216.1,Taylor & Francis Ltd,Article,"Fisheries; Bycatches (Fisheries); Fish populations; Mexico, Gulf of; Finfish Farming and Fish Hatcheries; Lutjanus campechanus; Mortality",,"Beginning in May 1998, the National Marine Fisheries Service has required that bycatch reduction devices be installed in penaeid shrimp trawl gear in the Gulf of Mexico. Changes in observer protocols were introduced, one of which was that all of the red snapper Lutjanus campechanus collected would be enumerated and measured when possible. This change has yielded catch and length information from the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery. To date, however, an integrated approach to determining the age composition, growth, and mortality of juvenile red snapper has not been attempted. To address this problem, we constructed a length-based, age-structured model to objectively estimate the growth and mortality parameters and age composition of the shrimp trawl bycatch of red snapper in the western Gulf of Mexico from 81 monthly length frequency data sets (a total of 239,521 fish were measured) from July 1999 to February 2007. Our modeling strategy was to make simple and straightforward representations of the deviations in growth from the mean trend, partial recruitment, density-dependent mortality, and population dynamics. Bayesian parameter estimation was accomplished by calculating the mode of the posterior distribution. Important findings of this paper include (1) the shrimp trawl bycatch during the first and third trimesters is dominated (86-87%) by age-0 fish, (2) the growth patterns of age-0 and age-1 red snapper suggest that the fish form an opaque annulus in winter months, (3) the natural mortality of age-0 fish appears to be about double (a minimum 70% increase) the value used in the last stock assessment, and (4) the evidence for density-dependent juvenile mortality is overwhelming. Inclusion of these findings in the red snapper stock assessment has the potential to substantially alter management practices.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=36871572&site=ehost-live

We also find that volume contains useful information for predicting volatility. However, unlike financial asset prices, though consistent with fish commodities prices, red snapper price volatility diminishes when the volume is high. Also, the effect of expected changes on transaction volume is more dominant than that of unexpected changes. Explicitly accounting for oil spill closures and the Individual Fishing Quotas (IFQ) program in other species as variance shift parameters significantly reduces volatility and improves the market efficiency response to shocks.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=118025815&site=ehost-live
Comparison of Harvest Control Policies for Rebuilding Overfished Populations within a Fixed Rebuilding Time Frame.,"Babcock, Elizabeth A.; McAllister, Murdoch K.; Pikitch, Ellen K.",North American Journal of Fisheries Management,2755947,,Nov-07,27,4,1326,17,28560179,10.1577/M06-124.1,Taylor & Francis Ltd,Article,"Harvesting; Fish populations; Fishery law & legislation; White marlin; Sandbar shark; Fishing; United States; All Other Amusement and Recreation Industries; Finfish Farming and Fish Hatcheries; Support activities for crop production; Crop Harvesting, Primarily by Machine; Finfish Fishing; Swordfish; Lutjanus campechanus; Striped bass",,"U.S. law requires that overfished fish populations be rebuilt within 10 years when biologically possible, and otherwise within the time it would take to rebuild in the absence of fishing plus one mean generation time (MGT). Most overfished populations can recover in less than 10 years; the exceptions are populations with very low productivity and some that are severely depleted. A range of harvest control policies, including constant fishing mortalities and variable harvest rate control rules, were compared in terms of their ability to rebuild overfished populations of five species within the required times. The North Atlantic swordfish Xiphias gladius and Gulf of Mexico red snapper Lutjanus campechanus populations were able to rebuild in 10 years, but the white marlin Tetrapturus albidus, sandbar shark Carcharhinus plumbeus, and darkblotched rockfish Sebastes crameri populations were not. The harvest policy that resulted in populations being rebuilt most rapidly was either a control rule that reduced fishing mortality with decreasing biomass or a constant harvest rate designed to meet the current rebuilding time requirement. The control rules we analyzed restricted catches at the beginning of the rebuilding period but allowed catches to increase rapidly as the population was rebuilt. Thus, there was a trade-off between relatively high catches early in the rebuilding period and high catches later in the rebuilding period when the population had been rebuilt and could sustain high catches. Whether the population was rebuilt more rapidly under a fixed rebuilding-time requirement or a control rule depended on the productivity of the population.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=28560179&site=ehost-live
Depth and Artificial Reef Type Effects on Size and Distribution of Red Snapper in the Northern Gulf of Mexico.,"Jaxion-Harm, J.; Szedlmayer, S.

Off coastal Alabama there are few natural reefs, but in the last 50 years government programs and private fishers have placed numerous artificial reefs in the northeast Gulf of Mexico with the goal of increasing fisheries production. We examined the effects of artificial reef depth and reef type on Red Snapper densities and size distributions. We used hook-and-line, fish trap, and scuba visual surveys to estimate Red Snapper densities on four types of artificial reefs: army tanks, pyramids, small reefs (e.g., metal cages, pipelines), and large reefs (e.g., ships, dry docks, oil platforms). Small Red Snapper (<33 cm TL) were significantly more abundant at shallower depths (<35 m) and on small artificial reefs. Army tanks showed significantly more large fish (>33 cm TL) at shallow sites (<35 m) than at deeper sites (>35 m); in contrast, pyramids showed significantly more large fish at deeper sites. Ontogenetic habitat shift and fishing mortality were the most likely factors that would explain these Red Snapper distributions. Worldwide, artificial reefs are being used to enhance fishery resources and for habitat restoration. We document the importance of reef design and deployment location for Red Snapper, as well as the need for future artificial reef deployments to consider the relevant variables that affect the species that managers are attempting to enhance.

Simulating a wide range of policies, the authors find Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) inspired policy efficiency frontiers that lead to finding those management strategies that offer the greatest level of economic surplus for any biological target, looking at both the east and west Gulf of Mexico fisheries. Red snapper has been declared overfished since 1988 and the 2005 SEDAR 7 stock assessment declared red snapper were overfished and undergoing overfishing. In November 2009, the update of the assessment declared that overfishing was no longer occurring but that the red snapper stocks needed to be rebuilt. In this analysis, it was found that red snapper are neither overfished or undergoing overfishing. The main difference between the present model and the SEDAR 7 model is that the latest model uses a higher mortality rate for juveniles and a density dependent model.

Diet shifts of juvenile red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) with changes in habitat and fish size.,"Szedlmayer, Stephen T.; Lee, Jason D.",Fishery Bulletin,900656,,Apr-04,102,2,366,10,14252249,,National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration,Article,Lutjanus; Predation (Biology); Fish food; Other Animal Food Manufacturing; Lutjanus campechanus; Fish habitat,,"We examined the diets and habitat shift of juvenile red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) in the northeast Gulf of Mexico. Fish were collected from open sand-mud habitat (little to no relief), and artificial reef habitat (1-m³ concrete or PVC blocks), from June 1993 through December 1994. In 1994, fish settled over open habitat from June to September, as shown by trawl collections, then began shifting to reef habitat--a shift that was almost completed by December as observed by SCUBA visual surveys. Stomachs were examined from 1639 red snapper that ranged in size from 18.0 to 280.0 mm SL. Of these, 850 fish had empty stomachs, and 346 fish from open habitat and 443 fish from reef habitat contained prey. Prey were identified to the lowest possible taxon and quantified by volumetric measurement. Specific volume of particular prey taxa were calculated by dividing prey volume by individual fish weight. Red snapper shifted diets with increasing size. Small red snapper (<60 mm SL) fed mostly on chaetognaths, copepods, shrimp, and squid. Large red snapper (60-280 mm SL) shifted feeding to fish prey, greater amounts of squid and crabs, and continued feeding on shrimp. We compared red snapper diets for overlapping size classes (70-160 mm SL) of fish that were collected from both habitats (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and multidimensional scaling analysis). Red snapper diets separated by habitat type rather than fish size for the size ranges that overlapped habitats. These diet shifts were attributed to feeding more on reef prey than on open-water prey. Thus, the shift in habitat shown by juvenile red snapper was reflected in their diet and suggested differential habitat values based not just on predation refuge but food resources as well.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=14252249&site=ehost-live
Estimating Recreational Effort in the Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper Fishery Using Boat Ramp Cameras: Reduction in Federal Season Length Does Not Proportionally Reduce Catch.,"Powers, Sean P.; Anson, Kevin",North American Journal of Fisheries Management,2755947,,Oct-16,36,5,1156,11,118485054,10.1080/02755947.2016.1198284,Taylor & Francis Ltd,Article,"Lutjanus; Effort in fisheries; Fish populations; Anglerfishes; Mexico, Gulf of; Administration of Conservation Programs; Boat ramps; Meteorological research",,"Estimating fishing effort is of critical importance in assessing population trends of exploited species. We used video camera footage collected by surveillance cameras to estimate effort during the federal recreational seasons for Red SnapperLutjanus campechanusduring 2012–2015 in coastal Alabama. For 2012 (40 d in duration) and 2013 (28 d in duration), we randomly sampled 20% of days within the season and counted the number of boats launched and number of potential anglers (total number of people) on each vessel during randomly chosen 5-min blocks of time during each daylight or dusk hour. For 2014 and 2015, the seasons were considerably shorter, 9 and 10 d, respectively, and we were able to count the number of boats launched and potential anglers during randomly chosen 5-min intervals every daylight or dusk hour of each day. Using hourly weather observations (wind and precipitation), day of the week (weekend versus weekday), boat launch site, and year, general linear models were constructed to predict potential Red Snapper anglers per hour. For all years combined, the model had anR2of 0.62, with a higherR2(0.71) for the same variables using just 2014 and 2015 data. Applying the model, we were able to predict total offshore anglers by summing the hourly predictions over the season. We then estimated total number and weight of Red Snapper harvested for this group of anglers. Reductions in season length were not proportional to catch reductions due to changes in angler behavior. Red Snapper catch (in pounds) were reduced by 26% with a 75% reduction in season length. Our findings demonstrate the utility of dockside cameras for estimating marine recreational fishing effort and demonstrate the nonstatic response of anglers to management changes.

Evaluating the Performance of Vertical Longlines to Survey Reef Fish Populations in the Northern Gulf of Mexico.,"Gregalis, Kevan C.; Schlenker, Lela S.; Drymon, J.

Such data streams are essential in evaluating population trajectories that are derived largely from harvest and age composition of landings. For example, high scientific uncertainty in the most recent stock assessment of Gulf of Mexico red snapperLutjanus campechanusresulted from a conflict between trends in fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data. Because sample sizes for the latter data were an order of magnitude lower, resolution of the conflicting trends was even more problematic. Recognizing the need for cost-effective expansion of fishery-independent data in the region, we evaluated the performance of vertical longline surveys for sampling reef fish within a large artificial reef zone in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, we (1) determined species composition and the length frequency of red snapper (the dominant species captured) as a function of hook size and bait type within our survey area during 2010; (2) evaluated the effect of different soak times on catch for various hook types (a combination of hook size and bait type); and (3) utilized our results to test the effect of artificial reef type on red snapper CPUE and mean size. During March–November 2010, we conducted 532 vertical longline sets, capturing 1,217 red snapper that ranged from 184 to 827 mm FL. Mean FL of red snapper differed among hook sizes, with 3/0 and 8/0 hooks sampling smaller fish than 11/0 hooks. Soak time trials revealed a significant effect of soak time on CPUE, with peak catch rates observed at 5 min. As habitat area increased, the mean size and CPUE of red snapper increased. We conclude that our vertical longline is an effective gear for sampling red snapper, and we recommend protocols to maximize its utility and standardize its use.

However, determining the effects of this hypoxic zone on fish and fisheries has proven to be more difficult. The dual effect of nutrient loading on secondary production (positive effects of bottom-up fueling, and negative effects of reduced oxygen levels) impedes the quantification of hypoxia effects on fish and fisheries. The objective of this study was to develop an ecosystem model that is able to separate the two effects, and to evaluate net effects of hypoxia on fish biomass and fisheries landings. An Ecospace model was developed using Ecopath with Ecosim software with an added plug-in to include spatially and temporally dynamic Chlorophyll a (Chl a ) and dissolved oxygen (DO) values derived from a coupled physical–biological hypoxia model. Effects of hypoxia were determined by simulating scenarios with DO and Chl a included separately and combined, and a scenario without fish response to Chl a or DO. Fishing fleets were included in the model as well; fleets move to cells with highest revenue following a gravitational model. Results of this model suggest that the increases in total fish biomass and fisheries landings as a result of an increase in primary production outweigh the decreases as a result of hypoxic conditions. However, the results also demonstrated that responses were species-specific, and some species such as red snapper ( Lutjanus campechanus ) did suffer a net loss in biomass. Scenario-analyses with this model could be used to determine the optimal nutrient load reduction from a fisheries perspective.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=115212457&site=ehost-live

Little is known about their life history or feeding biomechanics during this time. However, recent studies have shown higher growth rates for juveniles located on mud habitats adjacent to low profile reefs, perhaps because of varied prey availability and abundance. To further investigate the habitat needs of juvenile red snapper and test hypotheses of feeding development, individuals were collected from a low profile shell ridge and adjacent mud areas on Freeport Rocks, TX, USA, and divided into three size classes (""3.9, 4.0-5.9, ?6.0 cm SL). Output from a dynamic lever model suggested an ontogenetic shift in feeding morphology. Biomechanical modeling also predicted that off-ridge juveniles would have slower, stronger jaws compared with on-ridge juveniles. Kinematic profiles obtained from actual feeding events validated the models' predictive ability. Analysis of prey capture events demonstrated that on-ridge juveniles exhibited larger jaw displacements than off-ridge juveniles. Shape analysis was used to further investigate habitat effects on morphology. Off-ridge juveniles differed from on-ridge juveniles in possessing a deeper head and body. Results from model simulations, kinematic profiles, behavioral observations and shape analysis all compliment the conclusion that on-ridge juveniles exhibited more suction feeding behavior, whereas off-ridge juveniles used more biting behavior. Habitat disparity and possibly available prey composition generated variations in juvenile feeding biomechanics and behavior that may affect recruitment.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=36151373&site=ehost-live

Using the nonparametric, nonlinear time series (NLTS) approach, we modeled dynamics of red snapper ( Lutjanus campechanus ) represented by time series of two fisheries-independent abundance indices and two fisheries-dependent abundance indices in the eastern and western portions of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). Further, we examined regional dynamics of red snapper in the two areas and explored the utility of NLTS models in generating short term forecasts. Overall, red snapper in the eastern Gulf and western Gulf displayed distinct patterns in terms of the Gulf-wide ecosystem indicators, which likely implies different underlying regional dynamics of the species. Moreover, dynamic features of red snapper differed between the two regions. Specifically, the system dimension (mean ± SE), i.e., the number of potential processes affecting the underlying dynamics of the species, was higher in the western Gulf (5.5 ± 1.32) than in the eastern Gulf (3.75 ± 1.44). The NLTS models exhibited significant skill (i.e., a measure of the goodness of fit (?) between observations and predictions) in forecasting red snapper abundance indices. The forecast skill (one year ahead) was 0.48 ± 0.01 for indices representing the eastern Gulf and 0.33 ± 0.05 for indices representing the western Gulf. The average dimension and forecast skill was 3 ± 1.43 and 0.37 ± 0.01 for fisheries-dependent indices, and 6.25 ± 1.32 and 0.45 ± 0.05 for fisheries-independent indices. These findings have implications for the Gulf red snapper fisheries in that the NLTS approach shows potential for forecasting stock abundance indices, and provides new information regarding the appropriate spatial scale for management of the species. Moreover, the ecosystem considerations in this study can be further explored to forecast the dynamics of red snapper for better assessments and management of the species.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=120404443&site=ehost-live

Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance revealed genetic heterogeneity among habitat patches within regions, but not among regions. A significant, positive spatial autocorrelation of microsatellite genotypes among fish sampled within the geographic range 50–100 km was detected. Bayesian coalescent analysis of historical demography indicated a decline of nearly an order of magnitude in the effective population size for red snapper across the area surveyed. The highest posterior probability for the current effective population size was 2163, approximately four orders of magnitude smaller than the estimates of red snapper census size. The results of the study demonstrate that spatial genetic structuring among young-of-the-year red snapper in the Gulf occurs at small geographic scales and is consistent with a metapopulation stock-structure model of partially connected populations. This accentuates the importance of maintaining healthy local spawning populations of red snapper in all regions across the northern Gulf.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=53061812&site=ehost-live

The model simulated the population dynamics of three fish species for 50 years on a 2-dimensional spatial grid. Growth, mortality, and movement were computed each hour for individuals of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), a croaker-like species (Micropogonias chromis), and a pinfish-like species (Lagodon rhomboides). We also included individuals of two other species (bluefish –Pomatomus saltatrix and a generic jack-like species), but only simulated their hourly movement and their effects on prey and predation of the focal species. The densities of five prey groups were simulated independently in each cell. Our results showed that increasing the number of reefs generally produced higher biomass, but at the cost of slower growth, and smaller individuals. Abundance was higher under fixed-AR recruitment and maximum refuge treatments. In all treatments there were diminishing returns on abundance and biomass with increasing number of artificial reefs. Experiment 2 showed that model results based on regularly spaced reefs were consistent with a real layout of reefs currently being sampled in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Management strategies for determining the habitat-value of reefs in the Gulf of Mexico should consider the number of reefs and the local spatial layout of the reefs to ensure they are optimally arranged. Field experiments performed should assist in resolving how fish recruit to artificial reefs and help determine their roles as fish refuges.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=67625645&site=ehost-live

These regulatory practices are neither feasible nor desirable for many fisheries, and have failed to conserve fishery stocks in other fisheries. Marine reserves may be an effective alternative management strategy for some fisheries. Here we develop a dynamic model of marine reserves applicable to inshore fisheries. In contrast to previous models of reserves, the model is fully dynamic and provides information on both equilibrium conditions and the path to equilibrium. A simulation model based on red snapper data from the Gulf of Mexico is presented. The simulation results suggest that marine reserves can sustain or increase yields for moderate to heavily fished fisheries but will probably not improve yields for lightly fished fisheries.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=18890508&site=ehost-live
Population structure of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) in U.S. waters of the western Atlantic Ocean and the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.,"Hollenbeck, Christopher M.; Portnoy, David S.; Saillant, Eric; Gold, John R.",Fisheries Research,1657836,,Dec-15,172,,17,9,109395985,10.1016/j.fishres.2015.06.020,Elsevier Science,Article,"Fish populations; Migration of fishes; Atlantic Coast (South Atlantic States); Mexico, Gulf of; Lutjanus campechanus; Fish genomes; Microsatellites (Genetics); Mitochondrial DNA",Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Population structure; Red snapper,"Population structure of adult red snapper ( Lutjanus campechanus ) from the southeastern coast of the United States (Atlantic) and the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) was assessed using genotypes at 16 nuclear-encoded microsatellites and mitochondrial (mt)DNA haplotypes of the NADH dehydrogenase 4 (ND4) gene. Initial tests ( F ST -based, hierarchical AMOVA) of spatial genetic homogeneity within and between regions were non-significant, consistent with a single population or stock of red snapper in the Atlantic and Gulf. Inferences derived from other statistical approaches were consistent with genetic and/or demographic differences within and between the two regions. The estimated, average, long-term migration rate between the two regions (0.27%) was well less than the 10% rate below which populations can respond independently to environmental perturbation. Comparisons of global estimates of average, long-term effective size ( N eLT ) with estimates from individual sample localities indicated genetic heterogeneity within both the Atlantic and Gulf. These results paralleled those of prior genetic studies of red snapper from the Gulf. Future genetics studies and other work on red snapper in both the Atlantic and Gulf should include approaches to identify demographically independent units within each region and assess their size, patterns of connectivity, and contribution to the fishery. Monitoring global and/or local effective size also should be considered.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=109395985&site=ehost-live

The incidence of skin lesions in 2011 sampling was most frequent in some bottom-dwelling species along the continental shelf edge north of the Deepwater Horizon site. Longline surveys revealed that by 2012 the overall frequency of lesions in northern Gulf of Mexico (NGM) fishes in the vicinity of the Deepwater Horizon had declined 53%, with severity also declining. Relatively high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites (up to 470,000 ng naphthalene equivalents/g bile wet weight), indicative of oil-related pollution, were found in fish bile in 2011; concentrations of summed PAHs measured in fish liver and muscle were relatively low (<35 ng/g) due to the efficient metabolism of these compounds by teleost fish. Significant declines in bile concentrations of naphthalene and phenanthrene metabolites in Red SnapperLutjanus campechanusbetween 2011 and 2012 indicate an episodic exposure to elevated levels of hydrocarbons of petrogenic origin. The composition of PAH parent compounds and alkylated homologs in Red Snapper liver samples was highly correlated with oil collected at the Deepwater Horizon wellhead but was less coherent with other PAH sources in the NGM. The elevated 2011 prevalence of skin lesions in some NGM species was unrelated to surface salinity or temperature anomalies and was not the result of an epizootic observable in our histopathology samples but was positively correlated with PAH concentration. Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that elevated skin lesion frequency is unrelated to PAH exposure from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

In this paper, we theoretically study and compare the short- and long-term impacts of these policies on individual anglers and fish stocks. Particular attention is paid to the issue of release mortality, which can have important consequences for policy effectiveness. Theoretically, we show the conditions under which these policies will be successful in achieving biological objectives. Implications for recreation demand analysis are discussed.

Sublethal effects of catch-and-release fishing: measuring capture stress, fish impairment, and predation risk using a condition index. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 513–521.The sublethal effects of simulated capture of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) were analysed using physiological responses, condition indexing, and performance variables. Simulated catch-and-release fishing included combinations of depth of capture and thermocline exposure reflective of environmental conditions experienced in the Gulf of Mexico. Frequency of occurrence of barotrauma and lack of reflex response exhibited considerable individual variation. When combined into a single condition or impairment index, individual variation was reduced, and impairment showed significant increases as depth increased and with the addition of thermocline exposure. Performance variables, such as burst swimming speed (BSS) and simulated predator approach distance (AD), were also significantly different by depth. BSSs and predator ADs decreased with increasing depth, were lowest immediately after release, and were affected for up to 15 min, with longer recovery times required as depth increased. The impairment score developed was positively correlated with cortisol concentration and negatively correlated with both BSS and simulated predator AD. The impairment index proved to be an efficient method to estimate the overall impairment of red snapper in the laboratory simulations of capture and shows promise for use in field conditions, to estimate release mortality and vulnerability to predation.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=48794467&site=ehost-live
Temporal and spatial comparisons of the reproductive biology of northern Gulf of Mexico (USA) red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) collected a decade apart.,"Kulaw, Dannielle H.; Jr.Cowan, James H.; Jackson, Melissa W.",PLoS ONE,19326203,,3/29/2017,12,3,1,39,122143747,10.1371/journal.pone.0172360,Public Library of Science,Article,LUTJANUS campechanus; FISH spawning; SEXUAL maturity in fishes; FISH stocking; BIOMASS; Finfish Farming and Fish Hatcheries,Age groups; Agriculture; Alabama; Animal cells; Biology and life sciences; Bodies of water; Cell biology; Cellular types; Developmental biology; Earth sciences; Fecundity; Fisheries; Geographical locations; Germ cells; Gulf of Mexico; Gulfs; Louisiana; Marine and aquatic sciences; Modes of reproduction; North America; Oocytes; Ova; People and places; Population biology; Population groupings; Population metrics; Research Article; Sexual reproduction; Spawning; United States,"In studies done a decade apart, we provide evidence of a recent shift toward a slower progression to sexual maturity as well as reduced egg production, especially among young, small female red snapper, in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). Slower maturation rates (among fish ?6 years old), lower GSI values and decreased spawning frequency were observed, and were especially pronounced in the northwestern Gulf. Furthermore, an Index of Reproductive Importance showed that young fish (ages 2–7) are contributing far less to the spawning stock in recent years, while older fish (>8 years) are contributing more, when compared to fish from the same age groups sampled in the previous decade. Coincident with these changes in reproductive output, fishing pressure has steadily declined gulf-wide, and spawning stock biomass and spawning potential ratio have increased. Thus, it is possible that the age structure of the red snapper stock is becoming less truncated, or that reproductive effort observed is due to the temporary influence of recent strong year classes produced in 2004 and 2006 as they begin to reach full reproductive potential. If the latter is true, careful documentation of the stock’s reproductive dynamics during a time of population growth provides new understanding at the meta-population spatial and decadal temporal scales. In contrast, if the former is true, a truncated age structure due to overharvest can limit the productivity of the Gulf red snapper stock. In addition, we have learned that red snapper females in the northwestern Gulf collected on natural reefs and banks have much higher reproductive output than those on artificial reefs in the form of standing and toppled oil and gas platforms, thus making the need to know the relative abundance of females found on these disparate habitats an important next step toward better-understanding factors impacting the reproductive dynamics of this species.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=122143747&site=ehost-live
The Potential for Unreported Artificial Reefs to Serve as Refuges from Fishing Mortality for Reef Fishes.,"Addis, Dustin T.; Patterson, William F.; Dance, Michael A.",North American Journal of Fisheries Management,2755947,,Feb-16,36,1,131,9,113395095,10.1080/02755947.2015.1084406,Taylor & Francis Ltd,Article,Fish populations; Coral reef fishes; Reef fisheries; Artificial substrates (Aquatic biology); Lutjanus campechanus; Balistidae,,"This study tested the potential for 27 artificial reefs, which were deployed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) but not reported to the public, to serve as refuges from fishing mortality for reef fishes. Red SnapperLutjanus campechanus(n= 2,114) and Gray TriggerfishBalistes capriscus(n= 267) were tagged at a subset (n= 9) of the study reefs from winter 2005 to fall 2007 to estimate their site fidelity and mortality rates. Mortality was also estimated from catch curves fit to Red Snapper and Gray Triggerfish age distributions that were estimated at the study reefs both before (2005–2007) and after (2007–2008) the GPS coordinates of the above subset were advertised to the public. Red Snapper site fidelity (f), estimated by fitting Burnham's (1993) joint encounter model to tagging data, was 12.8% per year; while estimated instantaneous total mortality (Z) of Red Snapper ranged from 0.08 per year during the closed recreational fishing seasons to 1.31 per year during the open seasons. Similar estimates were not available for Gray Triggerfish due to inadequate model structure. Prior to reporting of reef coordinates to the public, estimatedZfrom the catch curve analysis was 1.04 per year for Red Snapper and 0.56 per year for Gray Triggerfish. After reporting, estimatedZincreased from 0.56 to 0.69 per year for Gray Triggerfish and from 1.04 to 1.14 per year for Red Snapper. The low site fidelity and high fishing effort in the region resulted in no discernible refuge effects for Red Snapper. A modest refuge effect occurred for Gray Triggerfish, fish which have been shown to display high site fidelity (>80% per year) to reefs; however, Gray Triggerfish mortality from fishing quickly increased following the reporting of the study reef coordinates. Our study results indicate that unreported artificial reefs that are deployed in areas of the nGOM where fishing is otherwise allowed are not likely to offer protection to reef fishery species.
